Created small project using Hibernate and Spring Boot. During this project I learned that Spring Boot essentially does a lot of thinhs to streamline what Hibernate does.

What I ended up doing was commenting out certain portions of Spring Boot code to then make this project run only as a Hibernate project to a MySQL database.
